# EXCEL_DASHBOARD_BIKE_SALES_ANALYSIS
As part of my 75-day data analysis challenge, I focused on creating a dashboard for bike sales analysis using Excel. This project has been instrumental in enhancing my skills in data visualization and dashboard design.

I developed a dashboard using a bike sales dataset. I created pivot tables, graphs, and charts to analyze various metrics, including occupation, marital status, children count, and commute distance. I then organized these elements systematically to design a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard that allows for quick data insights with just a click.
